# Dealing With Addresses
Addresses can be challenging strings to work on, especially if they do not follow any apparent structure. In this example, I will clean selected addresses of hospitals in Lima, the capital city of Peru.
Addresses in Lima tend to seem unstructured since, sadly, urbanization is not complete. though, some addresses have a standardized way of being declared while others have a complete different style. With this code, I was able to tackle of of the many problems addresses in Lima has: the references after the street number. 

The original data for this example belongs to the Ministry of Health. I made the small subset and you are more tha welcome to use it. Though, it will be nice to refere to the author if you are using the code =).
